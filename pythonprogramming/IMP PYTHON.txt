If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints dots (...)
to let you know that the definition isnâ€™t complete:
>>> def print_lyrics():
... print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
... print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")
...
To end the function, you have to enter an empty line.
